# CSE 4099: Capstone Project
## by Divij Kulshrestha [17BCE2116] and Mohith J [17BCE2135]

This repo contains Python code for the [web application]() we built for our capstone project. 

# Aim
Our project aims to use machine learning to forecast the level of pollution (specifically, PM 2.5 values) for vairous urban Indian cities using publicly available pollution and meteorological data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/), the Central Pollution Control Board website, and the [Reliable Prognosis Weather Archive](https://rp5.ru).

Air Pollution Web App - https://pollution-forecast.herokuapp.com/

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

    * streamlit
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * xgboost
    * requests
    * pytz
    * pickle
